## Hello there! My name is Luke Parker

#### What am I spending my time on?

- **Passion Project**: I'm currently working on a rebuild of [TempusHub](https://github.com/Hona/TempusHub) which aims to restore data lost to time, and provide never before possible reporting and analytics. This project is called [TF2Jump](https://github.com/Hona/TF2Jump.xyz) ([tf2jump.xyz](https://tf2jump.xyz))

- **Learning**: I'm currently going deep in the Vertical Slice Architecture rabbit hole. I built the [SSW VSA template](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.VerticalSliceArchitecture) and started [documenting VSA under the SSW website](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.VerticalSliceArchitecture.Documentation/blob/main/learn/cookbook/history.md)

### Here's some sites that I host
